# ðŸš€ React Native Boilerplates

This project contains React Native boilerplates that can be used to kickstart a mobile application. The projects will be updated to adapt to the latest version changes.

It will also contain _3rd party library integrated project examples_ to help new react-native developers in integrating these modules.

## Setups

The boilerplates are added according to level and basic initial setup.

- [Simple Project with Redux and React Navigation v4](Simple%20Project%20Boilerplate%20%2B%20Redux%20%2B%20RNv4)
- [Simple Project with Redux and React Navigation v5](Simple%20Project%20Boilerplate%20%2B%20Redux%20%2B%20RNv5)

### Note:

I have not added the complete project but just the setup files and given the instructions. I had tried `react-native-rename` but as it has issues relating to renaming ios folders in **Windows 10**, I have decided to just give setup files and not a project.

Also, it makes it easier for you as a developer to just copy the independent files & folders rather than overwriting project folders like android & ios.
